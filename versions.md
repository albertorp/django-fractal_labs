# main: basic config 2023 11 13
Basic app as per Pegasus, with 2 scheleton apps added:
customers
employees

However, in the beginning the employees app will not be used. Employees will just be users and for the moment we do not need to track additional information about them. 
We will have a separate group called "collaborators" that will have extra permssions to be able to edit items
